# Food-Fun
This is a final project in mobile development course I took,
We learned in the course many useful things such as:
-Threads in mobile
-Firebase Database
-Firebase Auth
-MaterialUI framework
-Firebase other APIs


This application gives you the oppurtunity to create a trip and calculate all the utilites needed to take to a trip - (Water, Food, Essentials)
I built it on adnroid studio with javabackend and firebase database and authentication.
